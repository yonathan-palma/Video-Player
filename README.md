## Project Description

Create a web page that enables the user to play videos while he can control its reproduction (play, pause, volume, screen).

### Little extra add-ons

Apart from the main purpose of the video player, you will find certain DOM Manipulations that were interesting to test while in the context of this exercise. **You are kindly invited to find them while testing the page.**

## Main Objective

As was mentioned before, the intention of this project is to practice DOM Manipulation. Here you must add the content of the page creating, appending and removing elements or you must modify its behavior when certain actions are performed by the user -like playing or pausing the video, changing the video for another, changing volume, or more alike actions-.

## Technologies used

This project was developed using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

## Special Challenges

The project has special parts to practice the DOM Manipulation of HTMLMediaElementes:

1. Every HTMLMediaElement has a set of specific properties and methods that should enable you to control the media you are manipulating. This can be an _audio_ element or, as it is in this case, a _video_ element.
2. For any video element in HTML, you can activate the video controls included in the browser by adding the _controls_ atributte. In this case, the controls panel is developed entirely to control the video behavior through events related to our panel.
3. The actions that our controls panel should enable are: play/pause video, video time progress in a bar form and skip in it, mute video, manipulate via keyboard, volume control and fullscreen mode.

## Key JavaScript Concepts Used

1. fetch()
2. add(), remove()
3. HTMLMediaElement, HTMLVideoElement.
4. addEventListener()
5. setInterval(), clearInterval()
6. offsetWidth
7. requestFullscreen
